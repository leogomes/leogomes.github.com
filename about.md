Born and raised in Brazil.

Living in France, where I feel home, since 2008.

Working for [Amadeus](/dayjob), where I manage a team of seven full-stack ninjas.
We come from six different countries and speak nine different languages, if you count them all.

Building large scale solutions for the travel industry. Enjoying it.
