JMH is the JVM Microbenchmark Harness developed as part of the [OpenJDK](openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh).
There are lots of nice resources about JMH out there. [This guide](http://java-performance.info/jmh/), written back in 2014, still provides some valuable information
for someone who wants to start with JMH. Then, there are [the samples](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/), 
which are a must-read and part of the source tree of JMH.

One thing that I couldn't find and that could be practical was a cheatsheet, so I put this one together. It's largely based on the
JavaDocs of the annotations, but I personally find it useful to have all the info on a single page.
