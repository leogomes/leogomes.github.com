Since 2008, I work for [Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com). We provide technology
to the travel industry serving more than 100 airlines, as well as travel agencies,
hotels, car rental and ferry companies worldwide.

We process over a billion transactions per day,
roughly the same as Amazon and e-Bay.
