These videos are probably a bit late for a post in May 2017, but they're still useful to me.

[How NOT to measure latency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ8ydIuPFeU)
The already classic talk from Gil Tene on the problems of measuring latency and what "coordinated omission" is.
A nice write-up of this talk can also be found on the [High Scalability blog](highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html).

[How to fail at benchmarking] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ6LEbjhVr4)
This is a kind of sum-up of what Gil Tene's said plus some nice introduction for people who are pretty new to benchmarking. It's pretty much Java/JVM-oriented, but principles also apply to other languages/runtimes. A well-humored version in French (the mother-tongue of the speaker) is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n8QQEhVJsw).


[How I Learned to Stop Worrying & Love the Lambda](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/java8-performance)
Todd Montgomery talks a lot about Aeron, but also about their experience with Java 8. It may be so 2015, but there are still some good advice on things that I've [seen being discussed recently](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jmh-dev/2016-August/002303.html), like streams API.
