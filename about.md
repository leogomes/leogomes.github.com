Born and raised in Brazil.

Living in France, where I feel home, since 2008.

I work for [Amadeus](/dayjob), where I have written software, managed a team for nearly four years and where I'm now a Performance Architect.

We build large scale solutions for the travel industry.

Mainly interested in [open-source](https://www.ohloh.com/accounts/leogomes/positions), [guitar playing](https://soundcloud.com/leonardo-gomes-23), [film photography](http://www.lomography.com/homes/leogomes) and cooking.
